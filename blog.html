          <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>

          <h2>Web development</h2>
          <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an
            intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of
            plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more
            comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web
            design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network
            security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

          <h2>React Developer Tools</h2>
          <p>React Developer Tools is a Chrome DevTools extension for the open-source React JavaScript library. It
            allows you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the Chrome Developer Tools.

            You will get two new tabs in your Chrome DevTools: "⚛️ Components" and "⚛️ Profiler".

            The Components tab shows you the root React components that were rendered on the page, as well as the
            subcomponents that they ended up rendering.</p>
